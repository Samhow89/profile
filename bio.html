        <h1>Bio</h1>

        <p>Hello, I'm Sam, a 19-year-old software engineering apprentice based in St Anne's. I've always been passionate about technology and its potential to shape the future, which led me to pursue a career in software engineering. I find it amazing how technology is becoming a part of everything we do, and I believe that software engineering is a field that will only continue to grow in importance.</p>
        
        <p>As an apprentice in the cloud engineering team at Places for People, I'm dedicated to expanding my skill set and gaining experience in various areas of software engineering. One of the most significant accomplishments of my apprenticeship so far has been meeting new people and learning multiple valuable skills.</p>
    
        <p>In my free time, I love playing the guitar and watching tech videos on the internet. I find it important to balance my work with my hobbies, so I usually separate the two. After finishing work at 5 pm, I typically have something to eat and then spend the evening playing the guitar. Later at night, I catch up with the latest tech developments by watching informative videos online.</p>
    
        <p>I'm also the proud owner of five cats, who keep me on my toes with their naughty antics. They usually wake me up early in the morning for their breakfast, and sometimes bring in small creatures like birds and mice. Despite their mischief, I love taking care of them and find joy in having them around.</p>
   
        <p>As a software engineering apprentice, I'm committed to contributing my best effort to every project I work on and continuously improving my abilities. I believe that software engineering is a field that offers endless opportunities, and I'm excited to see where my journey in this field will take me in the future.</p>
